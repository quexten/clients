# RegistrationStart Component

The Auth-owned RegistrationStartComponent is to be used for the first step in the new email
verification stage gated registration process. It collects the environment (required), the user's
email address (required) and optionally their name. On cloud environments, it requires acceptance of
the terms of service and the privacy policy; the checkbox is hidden on self hosted environments.

## Web Examples

Note that the self hosted option is not present in the environment selector.

### EU Region

### Query Params

The component accepts two query parameters: `email` and `emailReadonly`. If an email is provided, it
will be pre-filled in the email input field. If `emailReadonly` is set to `true`, the email input
field will be set to readonly. `emailReadonly` is primarily for the organization invite flow.
